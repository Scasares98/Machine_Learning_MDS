Lending Club <- EDA and prediction modelling of the Lending Club dataset (Second Author: Gonzalo Carretero Ursúa)

Typically, commercial and non-commercial banks are the main lenders for loans. In contrast of those, Lending Club (LC) is a peer-to-peer online lending platform. It is the world’s largest marketplace connecting borrowers and investors, where consumers and small business owners lower the cost of their credit and enjoy a better experience than traditional bank lending, and investors earn attractive risk-adjusted returns.

The goal for this project is to create a model prediction able to assign wether a person (or group of people) will be able to pay te loan they have acquire with the lenders. First, we will develop a Exploraoty Data Analysis in order to realize which variables we should introduce in our model and later on, choose the prediction model that best fit with our dataset.

The models we will be using to predict are:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XG Boost
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
